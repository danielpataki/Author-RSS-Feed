# Author RSS Feed

A widget which lets you show different RSS feeds for your authors on their author pages and posts.

## Description

The Author RSS Widget is very similar to the default RSS widget but offers author-specific RSS feeds. This means that you can display the RSS feed of your authors on their author archive page or posts that they've written.
